		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>15 ounce of Ricotta cheese</li>
			<li>2 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1 cup of shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>2 eggs</li>
			<li>1 minced medium onion</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons of chopped parsely</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon of pepper</li>
			<li>2 jars of Alfredo sauce</li>
			<li>16 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
			<li>2 pounds of cooked and cubed lobster meat</li>
			<li>10 ounce baby spinach leaves</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 375 &deg;F (190 &deg;C). Grease a 9&times;13-inch basking dish.</li>
			<li>Place ricotta cheese into a large bowl. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar, 1/2 cup mozzarella, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and eggs. Mix in onion, parsley, garlic, and pepper.</li>
			<li>
				Spread 1 1/2 cups Alfredo sauce over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with a layer of 4 lasagna noodles. Arrange 1/3 of the lobster meat over noodles, then cover with 1/3 of the spinach and another layer Alfredo sauce.<br>
				Repeat layers twice more: noodles, lobster meat, spinach, and sauce. Sprinkle remaining Cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan over top. Give the whole pan a gentle shake to get everything settled in.
			</li>
			<li>Cover the baking dish loosely with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 45 min. Remove the foil and continue baking until cheese is browned, about 10 more min.</li>
			<li>Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
